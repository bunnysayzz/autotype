## Features

- Paste text and have it automatically typed into any application
- Adjustable typing delay (0.01 to 0.2 seconds between keystrokes)
- 5-second countdown to switch to your target application
- Status indicator showing typing progress
- Menu bar application for easy access

## Requirements

- macOS 10.13 or later
- Xcode 12 or later (for building from source)

## Installation

### Option 1: Download the pre-built app

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/bunnysayzz/autotype/releases) page
2. Move AutoType.app to your Applications folder
3. Grant accessibility permissions when prompted

### Option 2: Build from source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bunnysayzz/autotype.git
   cd autotype
   ```

2. Run the build script:
   ```
   chmod +x build.sh
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. Run the install script to copy to Applications:
   ```
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

## Usage

1. Click the keyboard icon in the menu bar to open AutoType
2. Paste your text into the text area
3. Adjust the typing delay if needed (default is 0.01 seconds)
4. Click "Start Typing" and quickly switch to your target application
5. After a 5-second countdown, the text will be typed automatically

## Typing Code

AutoType works great for typing code into editors, terminals, or other applications:

1. Paste your code into the text area
2. Set a comfortable typing delay (0.01-0.02 seconds works well)
3. Click "Start Typing" and switch to your code editor
4. The code will be typed with proper line breaks, and most editors will automatically handle indentation

## Permissions

AutoType requires accessibility permissions to function properly. You'll be prompted to grant these permissions when you first run the app. If you need to grant them manually:

1. Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
2. Click the lock icon to make changes
3. Add AutoType.app to the list of allowed applications

## Development

The application consists of three main Swift files:

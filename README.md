## Tips & Tricks

- Use a slower typing speed (0.05-0.1s) for more reliable typing in slower applications
- For code snippets, AutoType automatically handles indentation
- The 5-second countdown gives you time to switch to your target application
- You can stop typing at any time by quitting the app from the menu bar
- Use Command+V to paste text quickly into the input area

## Requirements

- macOS 10.13 or later
- 64-bit Intel or Apple Silicon Mac
- Accessibility permissions enabled
